these are notes i am taking out during the video

-running npm init -y will download the package.json into the code
-npm i express will download the express packets (or the node_modules folder) onto the code

-running npm run serve it will run the code (we wrote the serve function into the package.json text file)

huh turns out:
-req stands for request
-res stands for result

if changes are made to the code (index.js) remember to restart the terminal

npm i nodemon lets me add code so i dont have to constantly reboot the terminal
>now we run: npm run dev

npm i mongoose and npm i in general download libraries for our application
